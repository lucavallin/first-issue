# Code of Conduct

We as members and contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community 
a pleasant experience for everyone, interacting in ways that contribute to a welcoming and healthy community.

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our code of conduct and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem in contravention of the code of conduct. Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove any content
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

Unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at
`coc@lucavall.in`. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.

## Examples of unacceptable behavior

* Personal attacks including derogatory comments
* Harassement of any kind (public, private, sexual...)
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email
  address, without their explicit permission
* Discussing politics and other controversial topics
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting or in a public community
