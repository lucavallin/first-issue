Welcome! üëãüèº

**First Issue** is an initiative to curate a list of accessible issues from popular projects, so developers looking for a new (or first) project to contribute to can get started quickly.

Open-source maintainers are always looking to get more people involved, but it can be challenging to become a contributor. We believe First Issue lowers the barrier for future contributions - and this is why it exists.

## Adding a new project

You're welcome to add a new project in First Issue, and we encourage all projects &mdash; old and new, big and small.

Follow these simple steps:

- To maintain the quality of projects in First Issue, please make sure the GitHub repository you want to add meets the following criteria:

  - It has at least three issues with the `good first issue` label or other labels defined in `firstissue.json` (see `labels` and the end).

  - It has at least 10 contributors.

  - It has at least 100 stars.

  - It contains a README.md with detailed setup instructions for the project, and a CONTRIBUTING.md with guidelines for new contributors.

  - It is actively maintained (last update less than 6 months ago).

- Add your repository's path (in the format `owner/name` and lexicographic order) to [firstissue.json](firstissue.json).

- Create a new pull-request. Please add the link to the issues page of the repository in the PR description. Once the pull request is merged, the changes will be live on [firstissue.dev](https://firstissue.dev/).

## How does it work?

First Issue is a static website that uses Next.js, React and Typescript. The data shown on the website is loaded from the [generated.json](generated.json) file, which is generated by [generate.ts](generate.ts) by querying the GitHub API to fetch issues from the repositories listed in [firstissue.json](firstissue.json). The labels defined in [firstissue.json](firstissue.json) are used to filter issues for the repositories.

To contribute new features and changes to the website, you would want to run the app locally. Please follow these steps:

1. Clone the project locally. Make sure you have a recent version of Node.js installed on your computer.

2. You can use the included [generated.json](generated.json) as dummy data or you can run `npm run prebuild` to fetch the latest data from GitHub yourself: for this, you will need to set the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable to a valid GitHub access token. Notice: repositories not maching the criteria listed above (see rules in [generated.json](generated.json)) are automatically removed from [firstissue.json](firstissue.json) when the [generated.json](generated.json) script runs.

3. Start the development server and open the app in your browser.

```bash
# install the dependencies
$ npm install
# start the development server
$ npm run dev
```

Good to know when you commit: the project contains a `pre-commit` hook that runs linters automatically to ensure code quality!
